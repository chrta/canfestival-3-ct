Kvaser driver for CANfestival, the open source CANopen stack.
(C)2008 Giuseppe Massimo Bertani 


This driver should work with any Kvaser product compatible with Kvaser's CANLIB4.
I tested it with CAN Leaf Professional (USB-CAN adapter) on a Suse10.1 Linux box
and CANLIB 4.72 Beta (Oct 1,2007). 

In order to compile the driver, you should already be able to run the CANlib examples,
and tools, to be sure that CANLIB is able to detect and drive your device.

NOTES ABOUT CANLIB4

Since the "Leaf" device was added recently to CANLIB, I had to download the latest linuxcan4
library sources from http://www.kvaser.com instead of use the CD software shipped with the device.

NOTES ABOUT WINDOWS

Sadly, Kvaser's Win32 CANLIB is not provided with sources, so CANLIB cannot be build with GNU
tools. LIB files for MSVC and BCC are provided with the DLL but the DLL itself is stripped and
I've tried an entire day to compile this driver under Cygwin without success, despite 
Wu Yongwei's hints (http://www.geocities.com/yongweiwu/dllfaq.htm).

This does not mean that it's an impossible task, but probably I left out something important. 
Temporary KO.

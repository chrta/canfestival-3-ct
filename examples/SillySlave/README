SillySlave example for CANfestival

Its purpose is only to check if the selected
driver works at least a minimum. The PC running this demo
must be connected through CAN bus to a working master that 
recognizes the slave nodeId. The slave should be configured
by the master, then switched to operative. After that, when
the master sends a SYNC, the slave answers with PDO1, 
containing an integer that increments each time it is sent.

Please have a look to main.h to tune the master and slave node IDs

It's all. Enjoy it.
